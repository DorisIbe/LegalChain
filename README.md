## Usage Examples

### Creating a Legal Contract

```clarity
;; First, create a contract template
(contract-call? .chainlegal create-contract-template
  "Employment Agreement"     ;; name
  "employment"              ;; category
  "US-NY"                   ;; jurisdiction
  "QmTemplateHash123"       ;; template-hash
  "standard"                ;; compliance-level
)

;; Then create a contract from the template
(contract-call? .chainlegal create-legal-contract
  u1                                    ;; template-id
  (list 'SP1ABC... 'SP2DEF...)        ;; parties
  "US-NY"                              ;; jurisdiction
  "employment"                         ;; contract-type
  u1000000                             ;; expires-at
  "QmContractTermsHash456"             ;; terms-hash
  "ipfs://QmMetadata789"               ;; metadata-uri
  u50000                               ;; total-value (in micro-STX)
  u2                                   ;; required-signatures
)
```

### Digital Signature Process

```clarity
;; Sign the contract
(contract-call? .chainlegal sign-contract
  u1                          ;; contract-id
  "QmSignatureHash123"        ;; signature-hash
  (some 'SP3WITNESS...)       ;; witness (optional)
)

;; Notarize signature if required
(contract-call? .chainlegal notarize-signature
  u1                          ;; contract-id
  'SP1SIGNER...              ;; signer
)
```

### Dispute Resolution

```clarity
;; File a dispute
(contract-call? .chainlegal file-dispute
  u1                          ;; contract-id
  'SP2DEFENDANT...           ;; defendant
  "breach-of-contract"        ;; dispute-type
  "QmEvidenceHash456"         ;; evidence-hash
)

;; Assign arbitrator
(contract-call? .chainlegal assign-arbitrator
  u1                          ;; dispute-id
  'SP3ARBITRATOR...          ;; arbitrator
)
```
